<h2>Section Info Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Section Info tool provides a way for instructors to efficiently
manage sections of a class. The tool is designed to help an instructor
manage a course that may consist of lectures, labs, discussions,
studio work, recitations, or any combination thereof.</p>

<p>The Section Info tool is designed to work with other tools, such as
Announcements, Gradebook, and Tests &amp; Quizzes.
</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sections:</strong> This tool allows you to create sections
in a course site. Information you may add about a section includes
days, time, assigned teaching assistant, room, current enrollment,
available slots, max enrollment, and the section category.</p>

<p><strong>Groups:</strong> Groups function much like
sections. However, groups are managed through the Site Info tool, and
they do not have the associated metadata that a section may have.
Also, in some cases, sections will be pre-loaded with official course
data; groups will not be.

</p><p><strong>Section categories:</strong> Choose from several options
for the type of section you wish to add. Categories include Lecture,
Discussion, Lab, Studio, and Recitation.</p>


<p><strong>Teaching Assistants (TAs):</strong> In a course site, you
may assign TAs to each section. You assign a site participant the role
of teaching assistant through Site Info. </p>


<p><strong>Set announcements for sections:</strong> You may set an
announcement to be viewable only by a specific section.  When you
create a new announcement, choose from the drop-down menu which
section should see the announcement.</p>


<p><strong>View Gradebook by section:</strong> To view the Gradebook
by section, in the Gradebook tool, choose from the drop-down menu the
section you wish to view.</p>


<p><strong>View Tests &amp; Quizzes by section:</strong> You may view
different assessments you have created by section by choosing the
section in the drop-down menu.</p>

section to which the TA is assigned.
