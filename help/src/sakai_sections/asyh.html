<title>Section Info: Sections and groups</title>
</head>

<h2>What are sections and groups?</h2>

<p>Sections and groups are two ways an instructor can more effectively
manage subsets of participants.  </p>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>Sections are managed using the Section Info tool.  A section may
have a variety of data attached to it, such as category, days of the
week, times, and an assigned teaching assistant (in a course site only).
  Depending on how the
software is implemented at a given location, the Section Info tool may
be loaded with official course sections.  If it is not, however, an
instructor can set those sections up.  </p>

<p>Sections have the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sections are managed through the Section Info tool.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>You may provide additional information about a section, such as title
(required), days, start time, end time, maximum size, and location.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Sections must be assigned to a given category. Categories include
lecture, lab, discussion, studio, and recitation.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>In a course site, an instructor may assign a teaching assistant to a section.
<br><br>

</li>
<li>Participants may not be in more than one section in a given category.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>Sections may be populated with official data, depending on implementation.
</li>
</ul>




<h3>Groups</h3>

<p>Groups are very similar to sections in that they are subsets of
participants for a given worksite.  However, groups are accessed
through the Site Info tool.  Also, a group doesn't have the associated
metadata, such as meeting times, that a section does.  </p>

<p>Groups have the following attributes:</p>


<ul>
<li>Groups are managed through the Site Info tool.  They are also
accessible through Worksite Setup in My Workspace.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Groups may
have a title.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Groups are not populated with official course data.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>While groups do not have an assigned teaching assistant per se, an
instructor may create an ad hoc teaching assistant by assigning a
participant a specific role.

</li>
</ul>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Both groups and sections work with Announcements, Tests &amp; Quizzes, and Gradebook.  </p>
